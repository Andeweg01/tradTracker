I enjoy traditional Irish music a lot and there's nothing better than being where it's played. 
Often I tried to look online for venues or pubs where the music is played near my hometown in county Cork, Ireland.
Of course you will find information, but I've often wished for a site where all the venues are shown.
This is where the idea was born to build a site with Google Maps functionality showing all the venues 
in county Cork where sessions with traditional Irish music are on.
