# Cork TradTracker.com

## Sascha Andeweg's Interactive Frontend Development Milestone Project for CodeInstitute

I enjoy traditional Irish music a lot and there's nothing better than being where it's played: the pub sessions. 
Often I tried to look online for venues or pubs where the music is played on a regular basis near my hometown in county Cork, Ireland.
Of course you will eventually find the information, but I've often wished for a site where all the venues (mostly pubs) are shown on a map,
the way that for instance booking.com does.
This is where the idea was born to build a site with Google Maps functionality showing all the venues in county Cork and 
the information where and when the trad sessions are on.

The only site I have found that tries to have a complete listing of sessions is <https://tradconnect.com/page/ireland-sessions-listing-pub>.
The lack of a map and the very plain presentation of tradconnect makes my idea the better option for county Cork. 
When proven successful however, the idea can be extended to more counties. Even cross border...


## UX
The goal of the site will be to provide a quick overview of all the locations where sessions are played regularly and a quick selection of locations on specific days of the week.

A few examples of how this site can benefit users:

### Music lover:

A person like myself might feel like enjoying a night out with good traditional Irish music. Visiting cork.tradtracker.com will show the map of Cork with markers where the music is on.
The required day can be selected and the locations are filtered on the day that sessions are on.
Clicking on the marker will give the user information on the location, the usual day that sessions are on, eventually - when shared by the organiser - some information on the type of music played and names of musicians.

### Tourist:

People visiting Ireland often consider being in a pub with trad music the ultimate experience on their holidays. 
It could take the tourist asking around, surfing the web for scattered information and a bit of luck to find this hidden gem. 
With cork.tradtracker.com the information is there for them. Pick a location and it'll show them where to go for a guaranteed good Irish night out.

### Pub owners:

Adding the information about regular trad sessions can generate extra revenue by attracting more customers.
Also the organiser of sessions can plan more effectively when he's up-to-date with the days that other pubs have their sessions.


## Features

The site will consist of very brief explanation of what can be found on the map and why this is the best place to find that information.
The map will be the main focus with the filter to select the day of the week.
A form for organisers to add their venue and additional information or to ask for more information.
An about page with some information about the maker and his intentions with this site.

### Features Left to Implement

* Filtering on the type of music
* Filtering on the instruments used
* More in-depth information on Irish trad
* Linking to TripAdvisor


## Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
