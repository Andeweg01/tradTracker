# Cork TradTracker.com

## Sascha Andeweg's Interactive Frontend Development Milestone Project for CodeInstitute

I enjoy traditional Irish music a lot and there's nothing better than being where it's played: the pub sessions. 
Often I tried to look online for venues or pubs where the music is played on a regular basis near my hometown in county Cork, Ireland.
Of course you will eventually find the information, but I've often wished for a site where all the venues (mostly pubs) are shown on a map,
the way that for instance booking.com does.
This is where the idea was born to build a site with Google Maps functionality showing all the venues in county Cork and 
the information where and when the trad sessions are on.

The only site I have found that tries to have a complete listing of sessions is <https://tradconnect.com/page/ireland-sessions-listing-pub>.
The lack of a map and the very plain presentation of tradconnect makes my idea the better option for county Cork. 
When proven successful however, the idea can be extended to more counties. Even cross border...


## UX
The goal of the site will be to provide a quick overview of all the locations where sessions are played regularly and a quick selection of locations on specific days of the week.

A few examples of how this site can benefit users:

### Music lover:

A person like myself might feel like enjoying a night out with good traditional Irish music. Visiting cork.tradtracker.com will show the map of Cork with markers where the music is on.
The required day can be selected and the locations are filtered on the day that sessions are on.
Clicking on the marker will give the user information on the location, the usual day that sessions are on, eventually - when shared by the organiser - some information on the type of music played and names of musicians.

### Tourist:

People visiting Ireland often consider being in a pub with trad music the ultimate experience on their holidays. 
It could take the tourist asking around, surfing the web for scattered information and a bit of luck to find this hidden gem. 
With cork.tradtracker.com the information is there for them. Pick a location and it'll show them where to go for a guaranteed good Irish night out.

### Pub owners:

Adding the information about regular trad sessions can generate extra revenue by attracting more customers.
Also the organiser of sessions can plan more effectively when he's up-to-date with the days that other pubs have their sessions.


## Features

The site will consist of very brief explanation of what can be found on the map and why this is the best place to find that information.
The map will be the main focus with the filter to select the day of the week.
A form for organisers to add their venue and additional information or to ask for more information.
An about page with some information about the maker and his intentions with this site.
